&nbsp;&nbsp;As I wrote on the last page, there isn't much to say about the client. very easy to understand, it's just a standard client.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want the client to be anybetter, you have to change the server first, so it can send out all kind of information, all that about the <I>"GetData"</I> you just raed.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all about the client. Not much no. But to tell you more would be a complete waste of time, more waste than all I told you about with the server. And no you don't want that I figure.
</DIV>
<DIV ID="SubSub">Ideas?</DIV>
<DIV ID="UL">
&nbsp;&nbsp;Normaly people should get the ideas them self, and then make the programs they want, but I have a little list with things you could improve the project with. If you do this, you try to program a network program, and it's always best to try it you'r self, that way you learn most. Well now the idea list:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B># User List - </B>Make a user list on the client. When the client logs on it automaticly send some data, to the server. This holds it name and maybe other information. The server then run it through it's <I>"GetData"</I>, then it sends the new information out to the other clients, that will add the new user to it's user list (wow it's almost mIRC now).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B># Whisper - </B>The clients can have private conversations that other clients can't read. Again with the <I>"GetData"</I>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B># AdminLogin - </B>Users could log in as administrators, after that they could kick/ban users, stop/restart server, get log, and much more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B># WhoIs - </B>A Client could send this command, the server should then send the information about the other user that the client wanted, this could be IP, ISP and other.<BR><BR>
You can find out more you'r self, go on to the ending page now.

<B>It can't send when connected?</B><BR>
Are you sure you do connect at all, you have to write you'r own IP or computer name, instead of the "197.193.1.105[IP or Computername]".<HR SIZE="1">
<B>Still don't work?</B><BR>
Try to use another port, remember to alter this on the Client as well as on the Server.<HR SIZE="1">
<B>Still don't work, HELP ME?</B><BR>
Check for type errors. Try looking at the code, and then check if it on the client form is called sckClient, and not sckServer, and on the server check for sckClient.<HR SIZE="1">
